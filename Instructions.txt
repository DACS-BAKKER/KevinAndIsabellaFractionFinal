Kevin and Isabella’s Calculator

Link: https://github.com/DACS-BAKKER/KevinAndIsabellaFractionFinal

Quick Instructions/Examples:

General fraction operations:
To add fractions: 1 ÷ 2 + 3 ÷ 4 = 5/4
To subtract fractions: 1 ÷ 2 - 3  ÷ 4= -1/4
To multiply fractions: 1 ÷ 2 * 3 / 4= 3/8
To divide fractions: 1 ÷ 2 ÷ 3 ÷ 4= 1/24

Using previously obtained value:
1 ÷ 2 = 1/2. + 3 ÷ 4 = 5/4

Use CPX for Complex Numbers
Formatted as follows: [a] [cpx] [b] is equivalent to a + bi.
What you would type: 2 [cpx] 4 = 2 + 4i
Example of operation: 2 + 4i ÷ 5 = 2/5 + 4/5i

PEMDAS:
1 + 2 * 3 ÷ 4= 5/2

*Square:
2 ^ 2 + 9 = 13

*Resets text after inputting square and another number. For instance, 3 ^ 2 and then entering 4 would reset it to 4.

Negative/Positive:
Inputting a +/- will flip the sign
9 [+/-] = -9

Cool Features:
- Complex numbers in the calculator (based off of fraction)
- Order of operations (simulating a normal calculator)
- Square button
- Inverse button
- Negative/positive button
- Resizable application dimensions based on buttons and text

Illegal Inputs:
The following inputs will yield an error printed out in the console.
- If an operation yields an integer greater than the 2,147,483,647.
- If it divides by 0, it is undefined.
- Too many characters in the text box to show.

Notes:
I wanted to model my GUI as user friendly as possible. I found that PEMDAS was very important to correctly obtaining the values and functions the user wanted. To this end, I stored the current operation and previous operation to perform order of operations.

Regarding my use of complex numbers, I made it so that the a and b in a + bi is used as a fraction. The simpler implementation would be integers, such as 5 + 6i, but I modified it so that inputs such as 5/2 + 6/4i could be implemented.

I opted to not use a fraction button because I thought it would make more sense for the user. It was a challenging implementation as it required PEMDAS.

Anyhow, have fun!
